This repository has code for computing supersingular orders using cycles in isogeny graphs. This code was used for the paper "Computing endomorphism rings of supersingular elliptic curves and connections to pathfinding in isogeny graphs" by Eisentraeger, Hallgren, Leonardi, Morrison, and Park. There is code for computing cycles in the isogeny graph and for computing the trace of an endomorphism arising from a cycle. The code for the algorithm for computing the trace of the endomorphism is adapted from Sutherland's code for Schoof's algorithm at https://cocalc.com/app/projects/bec670ef-3089-49ad-a790-f587e6579df9/files/18.783%20Lecture%206%20Division%20polynomials.sagews.
